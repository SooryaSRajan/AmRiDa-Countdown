      Countdown to the end of Amrita - 2023 BTech CSE Batch as students here :)
      <br>
      To AmriDa, we just happen to be a bunch of students, but to us, this is everything.
      <br>
      May the end of this countdown be a reminder to the best days we had here. It shall forever remain as a relic on
      this IP address :).

      Just another developer with a tad bit extra access to stuff.
